# Course-Project-1
Exploratory Data Analysis Project 1
This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for machine learning datasets. In particular, we will be using the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set” which I have made available on the course web site:

Dataset: Electric power consumption [20Mb]
Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.
library("data.table")

setwd("~/Desktop/datasciencecoursera/4_Exploratory_Data_Analysis/project/data")

#Reads in data from file then subsets data for specified dates
powerDT <- data.table::fread(input = "household_power_consumption.txt"
                             , na.strings="?"
                             )

# Prevents histogram from printing in scientific notation
powerDT[, Global_active_power := lapply(.SD, as.numeric), .SDcols = c("Global_active_power")]

# Change Date Column to Date Type
powerDT[, Date := lapply(.SD, as.Date, "%d/%m/%Y"), .SDcols = c("Date")]

# Filter Dates for 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02
powerDT <- powerDT[(Date >= "2007-02-01") & (Date <= "2007-02-02")]
